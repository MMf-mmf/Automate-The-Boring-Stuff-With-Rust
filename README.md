# Automate The Boring Stuff With Rust (Source Code)

## Getting Started

To compile and run the Rust programs in this repository, you can use the following commands:

### Compile a Rust file
- rustc -O [filename].rs

### Run the compiled program
- ./[filename]


### Example
For instance, to compile and run the `rustc -O collatz.rs` followed by `./collatz` command.



Note: The `-O` flag enables optimizations during compilation.
